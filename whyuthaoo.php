The current waste situation in Nepal is frustrating. 
Despite the huge number of waste entrepreneurs, 
tons of recyclable waste still ends up in the Landfill each year. 
Our mission is to gap this bridge between waste entrepreneurs and waste sellers. 
Help us help our environment and join our revolution by selling your recyclables!
