**Uthaoo: Online Scrap Collection System**

Uthaoo is a digital platform that simplifies scrap collection by allowing users 
to sell surplus scrap to collection companies through an easy-to-use online interface. 
It offers simple registration, competitive pricing, and an intuitive experience. 
Sellers can request collection once they accumulate 100 kg of scrap, 
optimizing routes and boosting environmental impact. 

This project primarily  focuses on CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing scrap data efficiently.
